The model is designed to predict the Urban Heat Island (UHI) Index using machine learning techniques, specifically a Random Forest Regressor. It integrates multiple geospatial datasets, including UHI index values, NDVI from Sentinel-2, and land surface temperature (LST) from Landsat, merging them based on geographic coordinates. The dataset undergoes preprocessing, including handling missing values and feature selection, before being split into training and testing sets. Hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV to optimize the Random Forest model. The trained model is evaluated using RÂ² score and RMSE, achieving high accuracy. Finally, predictions are generated for new locations from the submission template, and the results are saved as a CSV file for further analysis.
